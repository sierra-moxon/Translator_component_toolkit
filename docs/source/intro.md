Introduction
============

## What is TCT?
Translator Component Toolkit is a python library that allowing users to explore and use KGs in the Translator ecosystems.
Users can check out the key functions here: https://gloriachin.github.io/Translator_component_toolkit/ 

## Key features for TCT
Allowing users to select APIs, predicates according to the user's intention. <br>
Parallel and fast quering of the selected APIs.<br>
Providing reproducible results by setting contraints.<br>
Allowing testing whether a user defined API follows a [TRAPI](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI) standard or not. <br>
Faciliting to explore knowledge graphs from both Translator ecosystem and user defined APIs.<br>
Connecting large language models to convert user's questions into TRAPI queries. <br>

## How to use TCT
### Install Requirments

To install TCT as a python library, first clone this repository, and then run `pip install -e .` from the root folder.

### Please follow the example notebooks (three utilities) below to explore the Translator APIs.

#### Connection finder
Example notebook for **[ConnectionFinder](https://github.com/gloriachin/Translator_component_toolkit/blob/main/notebooks/Connection_finder.ipynb)**

#### Path finder
Example notebook for **[PathFinder](https://github.com/gloriachin/Translator_component_toolkit/blob/main/notebooks/Path_finder.ipynb)**

#### Network finder
Example notebook for **[NetworkFinder](https://github.com/gloriachin/Translator_component_toolkit/blob/main/notebooks/Network_finder.ipynb)**

#### Translate users' questions into TRAPI queries
Example notebook for translating users' questions into TRAPI queries can be found [here](https://github.com/gloriachin/Translator_component_toolkit/blob/main/notebooks/Question2Query_chatGPT.ipynb). 

#### Connecting to a user's API
API should be developed following the standard from [TRAPI](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI). <br>
An example notebook for add a user's API can be found [here](https://github.com/gloriachin/Translator_component_toolkit/blob/main/notebooks/Connecting_userAPI.ipynb).<br>
**Warning: It does not work if no user' API is established**<br>
